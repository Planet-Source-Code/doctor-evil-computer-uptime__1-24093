### Description

Here's a silly little app that will tell you how many days, hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds that Windows has been running.
 
### More Info
 
The count gets all screwed up after a month of uptime, but you don't need to worry about that unless you are running NT. [a real OS ;)]
